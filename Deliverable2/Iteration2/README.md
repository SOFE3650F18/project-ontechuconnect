# Iteration 2

## Step 2

### Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

In this iteration our goal is to begin to setup the primary functionality of the CMS.

#### Functional

- UC-1
- UC-2
- UC-3
- UC-4
- UC-5
- UC-9
- UC-10

#### Constraints

- CON-6
- CON-5
- CON-4
- CON-3
- CON-1

## Step 3

### Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

In order to refine the primary functionality of the CMS, we must work on refining the backend to impliment the functionailty

## Step 4

### Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

| Design Decisions and Location | Rationale and Assumptions |
|---|---|
|Using MongoDB|We are using MONGODB as our DBMS for this system because we are using a full-stack JavaScript application with the MEAN stack
|Using Digital Ocean|We are using Digital Ocean as the hosting for the VPS, since they have many server locations across the world, as well as automatic memory allocation alterations so that you can scale the system.
|NGINX|We are going to use NGINX on the server as the reverse proxy, since it has automatic load balancing


## Step 5

### Instantiate Architectual Element, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

| Design Decisions and Location | Rationale |
|---|---|
|REST API|RESTful api for communication with the server

## Step 6

### Sketch views and Record Design Decisions
