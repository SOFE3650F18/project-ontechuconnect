# Iteration 3

## Note

Two people are working on this through live share via VSCode therefore this documents commits is 50% of each students work.

## Step 2

### Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

The focus of this iteration is on QA-3, UC-6 and CON-2.  
The focus is to implement a student workspace, allow profs to add as many TA's as possible and implement mobile/portable version of application.

## Step 3

### Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

For this scenario the elements that will be refined are the physical nodes that were identified during the first iteration:

- API server
- Database Server
- UI (Mobile Accessibility)

## Step 4

### Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

Design Decisions and Location|Rationale and Assumptions
---|---
Collaborative Work Environment|With this students will be able to work collaboratively without leaving the CMS
Multiple TA Adding|Allow Professors to add as many TA's as required for courses aside from the one required TA
Mobile Version|Create a mobile version of the app to allow for multi platform use

## Step 5

### Instantiate Architectual Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

## Step 6

### Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions

## Step 7

### Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose

Drivers completely finished at this point have been set to done on the kanban.  
The current iterations addressed drivers focus on additional functionality as well as a core constraint that would have been costly to implement until this stage of development.
